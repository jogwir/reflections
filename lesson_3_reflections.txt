When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to backup your repository with the cloud, share it publically, or have multiple people 
working on it who may be in different locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote repository?

Changes might be made to the remote repository which are not ready to be pulled into your working directory yet
and may impact your project. Similarly if you pushed automatically, you might push unfinished changes or
changes that are not ready for public viewing.
